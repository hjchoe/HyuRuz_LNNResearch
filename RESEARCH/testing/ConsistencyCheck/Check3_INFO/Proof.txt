Model:
     Check3

Premises:
     (A → B) : True
     (B → C) : True

Query:
     (A → C) : Fact.UNKNOWN

Derivation Solution:

     * The model was unable to converge on a solution during direct proof. Attempting PROOF BY CONTRADICTION...

     [ (A → C) : FALSE ]       Proof By Contradiction                                  
     [ A : True ]              Absorption 1               from [ (A → C) : False ]     
     [ C : False ]             Absorption 2               from [ (A → C) : False ]     
     [ B : False ]             Modus Tollens              from [ (B → C) : True ]      
     [ A : CONTRADICTION ]     CONTRADICTION              from [ (A → B) : True ]      
     [ B : CONTRADICTION ]     CONTRADICTION              from [ (A → B) : True ]      

     * The model has found a CONTRADICTION.

     QUERY [ (A → C) ] is TRUE due to Proof by Contradiction
