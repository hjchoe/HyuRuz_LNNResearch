Model:
     HypotheticalSyllogism

Premises:
     (P → Q) : True
     (Q → R) : True

Query:
     (P → R) : Fact.UNKNOWN

Derivation Solution:

     * The model was unable to converge on a solution during direct proof. Attempting PROOF BY CONTRADICTION...

     [ (P → R) : FALSE ]       Proof By Contradiction                                  
     [ P : True ]              Absorption 1               from [ (P → R) : False ]     
     [ R : False ]             Absorption 2               from [ (P → R) : False ]     
     [ Q : False ]             Modus Tollens              from [ (Q → R) : True ]      
     [ P : CONTRADICTION ]     CONTRADICTION              from [ (P → Q) : True ]      
     [ Q : CONTRADICTION ]     CONTRADICTION              from [ (P → Q) : True ]      

     * The model has found a CONTRADICTION.

     QUERY [ (P → R) ] is TRUE due to Proof by Contradiction
